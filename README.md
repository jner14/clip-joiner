# Clip Joiner
The user can select a working directory where from all mp4s can be compiled
into one large clip and then saved in the same location.  The name of each clip
is used to add a sub-chapter heading.

Potential Changes:
- Ask user to set the length of removal from videos' names instead of hard coded to 8
- Remove file type based off last dot not based off -4 index position
- Make selecting directory more convenient
- Add compatibility for other files types than mp4
- Add dark 90% transparent box behind text to make easier to read
- Add Title text to start of finished clip
- Add 'smart' ability to detect new video group additions and ask user if
    he wants to change to that directory
